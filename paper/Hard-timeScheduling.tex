\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\nop{
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the related work in Section~\ref{sec:work} and the background knowledge in Section~\ref{sec:background}. In Section~\ref{sec:Tradeoff}, we discuss the tradeoffs in model transform in stochastic network calculus. In Section~\ref{sec:impact}, we investigate the impact of model transform on performance evaluation. In Section~\ref{sec:integration}, we present a simple methodology for model buildup and performance analysis. In Section~\ref{sec:example}, we use an example to illustrate some ``tricks" in the application of stochastic network calculus. The paper is concluded in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Model and Problem Formulation} \label{sec:model}

We make the following assumptions on tasks execution in the sensor nodes, which are generally true but might not be absolutely necessary for certain application scenarios. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item (A1) The requests for all tasks are periodic, with constant interval between requests. 
	\item (A2) Each request of a task has a hard deadline, which is defined as the time when the next request for the task arrives. 
	\item (A3) A task has constant run-time and consumes constant energy\footnote{Energy consumption on sensor nodes largely depends on the operations of peripheral devices (e.g., sensors, wireless transmitters) associated with the task instead of executing code in the microprocessor.}. Run-time refers to the time which is taken by the microprocessor to execute the task without interruption.
	\item (A4) The task drains the power with a constant rate during its execution time.       
	\item (A5) The tasks are independent in that requests for a given task do not depend on the initialization or the completion of requests for other tasks.	
\end{itemize}

The sensor nodes consist of an energy harvestor component with the following assumptions
 \begin{itemize}
	\item (A6) The energy harvestor provides energy source to the node with a power function $P_S(t)$, which can be modeled as a stationary random process during the time in consideration.
	\item (A7) The sensor node also includes an energy storage (capacitors or rechargeable batteries) with the maximum capacity of $C$. 
\end{itemize}
 
We can denote a set of recurring tasks by $\{\tau_1, \tau_2, \ldots, \tau_n\}$, with each task represented by a tuple $\tau_i = <I_i, E_i, T_i>$, where $I_i$ denotes the periodic interval time between requests, $E_i$ denotes the energy consumption of the task, and $T_i$ denotes the run-time of the task. We can denote the energy component by $<C, P_S(t)>$. For a set of tasks scheduled according to some scheduling algorithm, we say that an \textit{overflow} occurs at time $t$ if $t$ is the deadline of an unfulfilled request or $t$ is the time when the energy level of the node drops to zero. A set of recurring tasks is scheduable if they can be scheduled so that no overflow ever occurs. 

We are interested in answering the following question: Is a given set of recurring tasks schedulable with a high probability?
