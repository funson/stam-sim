\section{Simulation Evaluation} \label{sec:simulation}

To study the results of using STAM to more effectively reduce energy violations in the proposed system, Matlab was used to simulate various tasksets. The simulation framework used both \emph{earliest-deadline first} (EDF) and \emph{lazy scheduling} (LS) algorithms to compare the effects of STAM.
